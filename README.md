# Data-Structure
 Data structures are “containers” that organize and group data according to type. The data structures differ based on mutability and order

# Data Structures in Python

This repository includes examples and implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. Below is an overview of the covered topics:

### Arrays
- Demonstrates how to access elements, slice arrays, and create sub-arrays.
- Example: Using loops to iterate through arrays and manipulate data.

### Bubble Sort
- Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- Includes an example of sorting an array and finding the highest and lowest grades.
- Demonstrates both manual sorting and using Python’s built-in `.sort()` method with the `reverse` parameter.

### Array Manipulation
- Examples of adding elements to arrays using `append()`, `extend()`, and `insert()`.
- Includes user input for dynamic array creation.

### Linear Search
- A simple search algorithm that traverses the array to find a target value.
- Example provided with step-by-step implementation.

### Binary Search
- An efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.
- Example implementation that divides the search space in half at each step.

### Dictionary (Hash Table)
- Demonstrates working with dictionaries inside arrays.
- Example provided for iterating through and accessing dictionary elements.

Each section includes Python code examples to illustrate the concepts. This repository is a valuable resource for learning and understanding data structures and their applications in Python.
